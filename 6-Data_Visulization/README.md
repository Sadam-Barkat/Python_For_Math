# Data Visualization

## 1: Introduction to Matplotlib
- **Overview**: Learn the importance of data visualization for data analysis.
- **Installation**: Install using `pip install matplotlib`.
- **Basics**: Plot simple line graphs and bar charts using `plt.plot()` and `plt.bar()`.

## 2: Customizing Plots
- **Customization**: Add labels, titles, and legends to enhance plot readability.
- **Additional Plots**: Create scatter plots with `plt.scatter()` and histograms with `plt.hist()` for varied data representation.

## 3: Exercises
- **Practice**: Visualize mathematical functions, such as sine and cosine waves, to apply your knowledge of plotting.

## 4: Review of Data Visualization
- **Recap**: Review key concepts, including plot types, customizations, and the best practices for effective data visualization.

## 5: Mini-Project
- **Objective**: Create a visual representation of a chosen mathematical concept, such as plotting a parabola or visualizing data trends.
- **Challenge**: Use multiple plot types and customize the visuals for a polished final project.
