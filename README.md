# Python for Math

Welcome to the **Python for Math** repository! This repository is designed to help you learn and apply mathematical concepts using Python programming. Here, you'll find a structured approach to mastering Python with a focus on mathematics, along with practical examples and projects.

## Table of Contents

1. **Introduction to Python**
   - Get started with the basics of Python, including installation and setup.

2. **Control Structures**
   - Learn about control flow in Python, including if statements, loops, and conditional logic.

3. **Functions and Modules**
   - Understand how to define functions, use built-in functions, and create your own modules for better code organization.

4. **Data Structures**
   - Explore Python's built-in data structures such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, and their applications in mathematical problems.

5. **Introduction to Libraries**
   - Discover powerful libraries like NumPy and SciPy that extend Pythonâ€™s capabilities for mathematical computations.

6. **Data Visualization**
   - Learn how to visualize data using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent mathematical concepts graphically.

7. **Working with Data**
   - Understand how to handle, manipulate, and analyze datasets to solve mathematical problems effectively.

8. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & Final Project**
   - Get introduced to OOP concepts in Python and apply them in a final project that integrates all the skills learned throughout this repository.
