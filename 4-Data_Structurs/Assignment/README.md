# Data Structures: Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries

## Description
This repository contains an assignment focused on understanding and implementing data structures in Python, specifically lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. The project covers various operations and functionalities associated with these data types, offering a comprehensive overview to help users work with them effectively.

## Features
- Basic operations for lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
- List manipulation (e.g., adding, removing, and modifying elements)
- Tuple usage and immutability
- Set operations (e.g., union, intersection, difference)
- Dictionary key-value pair operations
- Sample problems and solutions for practicing each data structure

## Usage
This repository is designed for beginners learning Python data structures. It can be used as a reference or study material to understand how these data types work, along with example implementations.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x installed
- Clone or download this repository to access the assignment files
