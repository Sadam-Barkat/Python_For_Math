# Python Data Structures Overview

## 1: Lists
- **Creation**: Lists are dynamic arrays used to store a collection of items.
- **Indexing and Slicing**: Access items using their index and extract sublists using slicing.
- **Common Operations**: Methods like `append`, `remove`, and `sort` allow modification and organization of list elements.

## 2: Tuples and Dictionaries
- **Tuples**: Immutable sequences, ideal for storing fixed collections of items.
- **Dictionaries**: Store data as key-value pairs, allowing quick data retrieval based on unique keys.

## 3: Exercises
- Practice manipulating lists and dictionaries through various operations such as adding, removing, and updating items.

## 4: Review
- Review the properties, use cases, and differences between lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

## 5: Mini-Project
- **Objective**: Create a small project that stores and retrieves formulas or sequences using data structures for practical application.

## Summary
Mastering lists, tuples, and dictionaries equips you with essential tools for organizing and handling data effectively in Python.
