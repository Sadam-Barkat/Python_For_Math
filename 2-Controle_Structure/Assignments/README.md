# Python Assignments: Conditional Statements and Loops

This repository contains solutions to programming assignments focused on conditional statements, nested conditions, logical operators, and loop control structures. The assignments are designed to build proficiency in Python basics.

## Day 1: Conditional Statements
- **Q1:** Prompt the user for five integers, then compute and print each integer's square.
- **Q2:** Calculate a workerâ€™s eligibility for a bonus based on working hours and task ratings.
- **Q3:** Check if the user can bake a desired number of cupcakes based on available eggs, using nested conditions.

## Day 2: Loops and Control Structures
- **Q4:** Prompt the user for two integers. Multiply if both are even; otherwise, add them.
- **Q5:** Generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number of terms using a `for` loop.
- **Q6:** Identify errors in a provided code snippet and correct it to print all prime numbers between 2 and 30.

## Usage
Each solution file includes:
- Problem prompt.
- Sample inputs and expected outputs.
- Explanations of any key logic or corrections made.
