# Control Structures in Python: if, elif, else

## Overview
Control structures in Python help to manage the flow of the program based on conditions. The `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements allow for decision-making capabilities in Python scripts, ensuring that certain blocks of code are executed only when specific conditions are met.

## Conditional Statements Explained

### 1. `if` Statement
- The `if` statement evaluates a condition and executes the block of code only if the condition is `True`.
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
