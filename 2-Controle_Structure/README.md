# Control Structures in Python

This section covers essential control structures in Python, including conditional statements, loops, and logical operators. You'll also practice with exercises and a mini-project.

## Topics Covered

1. **Conditional Statements**
   - Use of `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements.
   - Nested conditions and logical operators for complex conditions.

2. **Loops**
   - Introduction to `for` loops and `while` loops.
   - Loop control statements: `break` and `continue` for flow management.

3. **Exercises**
   - Practice exercises to build skills in using loops and conditions.

4. **Mini-Project: Number Guessing Game**
   - A fun project to apply control structures in creating an interactive number guessing game.

5. **Review**
   - Summary and best practices for control structures in Python.
